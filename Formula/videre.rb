# Homebrew formula for videre.
#
# Ships the prebuilt binaries from the GitHub release rather than building from
# source: a source build compiles candle and ONNX Runtime, which takes minutes
# to tens of minutes, and the released artifacts are already verified (each is
# downloaded onto a clean runner and actually executed before the release is
# published).
#
# No Intel macOS bottle. ONNX Runtime ships no prebuilt binaries for
# x86_64-apple-darwin, so videre cannot be built for that target at all.

    <<~EOS
      Model weights are downloaded on first use, not at install:
        videre embed  ~780 MB (semantic search)
        videre faces  ~180 MB (face detection)

      scan, dedupe, fix-dates, prune, stats and locations need no model at all.
